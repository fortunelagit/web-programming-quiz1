                Actually this is very difficult. It's not like I can talk about different types of tofu.
                So what I'm going to elaborate next are the foods I like to eat when I'm home.</br>
                <ol>
                  <li>
                    Terancam
                    </br><img src="images/terancam.jpg" width="400px" class="img-center" alt="terancam-food"></br>
                    <p class="text-left">I am not talking about 'terancam' as in threatened, but a real food. 
                      This food is made of coconut milk mixed with shredded cucumber, basil, and many other vegetables.
                      It tastes very fresh and keeping it in refrigerator allows it to lasts longer.
                    </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Botok
                    </br><img src="images/botok.jpg" width="400px" class="img-center" alt="botok-food"></br>
                    <p class="text-left">
                      This food is made of shredded coconut mixed with tofu, star fruit, 'petai', basil or 'lamtoro'.
                      Sometimes, locals would mix their own types of ingredient. Alright, enough with vegetable dish, next will be meaty dish.
                    </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Roasted Chicken
                    </br><img src="images/roast-chicken.jpe" width="400px" class="img-center" alt="roast-chicken-food"></br>
                    <p class="text-left">
                      You can tell just from the name it could never be a local food. But what could I do, I like it so much. 
                      Actually, there is very sad story about this, but I'll be keeping it to myself.
                      The best part of roasted chicken is the skin, especially if it's a little burn. So yummy~
                    </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Bandung Scorched Bread
                    </br><img src="images/roti-bakar.jpg" width="400px" class="img-center" alt="roti-bakar-bandung"></br>
                    <p class="text-left">
                      I know, I know, I'm not claiming it. It's really from Bandung. But it's really tasty.
                      I especially like cheese flavored one. Very yummy~
                    </p>

                </ol>
                I wonder if you notice my favoritism from the explanations above. 
                Haha, what can I do, after all I'm a carnivore. Next, I will talk about tourist attractions in my hometown.
