              I said it before, my hometown is in Kediri Regency. I live in its Semen District.
              Next up, I took some info from Wikipedia. Why? Cause I don't know what to write.</br>
              <p class="style-italic">Kediri Regency is a regency (kabupaten) located in East Java province, Indonesia.</br>
              It is one of two 'Daerah Tingkat II' that has the name 'Kediri' (The other is the City of Kediri).</p>
              </p>
              Alright, fair enough I also know about that.
              <p class="style-italic"></br>Kelud mountain, one of the most active volcanoes in Indonesia, 
              is partially administered by the Government of Kediri Regency (along with Blitar Regency).</p>
              Ahh, no wonder my house also got rained down by stones and sands when it erupted.
              <p class="style-italic"></br>The regency also contains the famed "Kampung Inggris", or English Village. 
              Kampung Inggris is a small area in the district of Pare where over a hundred businesses offering various English courses are clustered. 
              Students come from all over Indonesia to take courses in the English Village, where it is common for people to speak with each other in English (rather than Indonesian or Javanese) for the sake of practice.</p>
              Alright, I need to clarify that I have never once visited Kampung Inggris. So don't ask me about it. :'' </br>
              Okay now is the time for me to show off my understanding of my hometown.</br>
              If I could use one word to explain my hometown, it would be TOFU!</br>
              Yes! The white one!</br></br>
              <img src="images/tofu.jpg" width="400px" class="img-center" alt="white-tofu">
              </br>The yellow one could also do!</br></br>
              <img src="images/yellow-tofu.jpg" width="400px" class="img-center" alt="white-tofu"></br>
              Alright, why do I say it's tofu? Because tofu is the recognized souvenir of this hometown of mine!</br>
              There are so many tofu shops there. Well, actually the tofu business is not as thriving as before. 
              But, it's true that time is changing, those without innovations will only get left behind in dust.</br>
              So, in conclusion, if you are visiting someone sick in Kediri, don't bring tofu. We are sick of them.</br>
              Alright, that's all for my hometown. Next, I will post about the local food.</br>
